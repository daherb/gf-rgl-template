# gf-rgl-template
A template for new RGLs

This repository contains concrete grammr files for all relevant modules of the RGL abstract syntax and provides a starting point
for the development of new RGLs.

To get started change XXX both in the file names and in the files to the language code of the language you are working on.
The grammar shoud compile out of the box but all functions are just placeholders that have to be replaced for the new language.

There are two additional branches: `emptyStrings` only uses empty strings as placeholders and `notYet` uses the `notYet` function
defined in `prelude/Prelude.gf` as a placeholder for all functions.
